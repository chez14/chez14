## Hello, Hai, 你好, こんにちは！

I’m Chris, a software engineer in ~~Bandung~~ Area. Welcome to my GitHub Profile
where I mainly use this account to contribute to report bugs,
sight-seeing, starring project, and seeing my colegues' new dungeon.


Most of my code now resides on GitLab, where I can just integrate GitLab's CI/CD
stuff on there. Here's the link:
- GitLab → https://gitlab.com/chez14

I also write blogs!
